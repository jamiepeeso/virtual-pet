Virtual Pet is your chance to care for your very own dragon.

You can name your dragon and then care for his needs. 
The dragon's needs are split into 3 catagories for you: hunger, bordom, and tired levels.
To care for your dragon you have 3 actions you can choose: feed, play with, or command your dragon to sleep.
Each of these actions have concequences.

If you choose to feed your dragon the dragon's hunger level will go down by 25, tired is increased by 10 and bored is decreased by 5. Each action is you choose will affect all three levels just like feed does. 

Need levels are also adjusted at the end of each turn.

If your dragon's need levels go above 50 your dragon has dies.

Have fun and keep an eye out for more to come!
